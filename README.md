# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Some info I found on forums

The best approach would be to bundle the model with your app using the bundleResourceIO method. Here's why:
Simplicity: Bundling the model with your app is the simplest method and doesn't require dealing with AsyncStorage limits or filesystem access.
No Need for Dynamic Loading: Since you're comparing two specific videos, you don't need to dynamically load different models at runtime. You can bundle the specific model you need with your app.
Offline Access: Bundling the model with your app ensures that the model is available even if the user is offline.




#I tried to align these but faced dependency hell and went back to current versions.

If the demo app crashes on startup, it is highly likely caused by incompatible package versions, specifically expo-gl and react-native. As of Jan 2022, the following version combination should work. It is tested on iPhone 13 Pro Max with iOS 15.1.1 and Pixel 2 with Android 9:

"expo": "~44.0.2",
"expo-camera": "^12.1.0",
"expo-file-system": "^13.2.0",
"expo-gl": "^11.1.1",
"expo-gl-cpp": "^11.1.0",
"react": "17.0.1",
"react-native": "~0.64.3",
